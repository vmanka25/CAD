## Team Work

### 4.1

#### Reflection
creating the ring was really easy and I probably should have been student B because Nixxon struggled a bit with the spinner. I didn't learn anything new with the ring.

### 4.2
#### Description
I had to follow instructions to create a key which would spin the spinner.

#### Reflection
This was pretty easy and using pi to dimension the gears on the key was pretty cool

### 4.3
#### Description
Nixxon and I had to assembele the launcher using various mates

#### Reflection
this was sort of difficult. the rack and pinion relation is used to relate a revolute and slider mate and it is not a mate by itself.

### 4.4-4.5
#### for this part I had to branch the copter then modify it
filler

#### Reflection
branching the main was kind of confusing but not that hard and to customize it I got rid of the circle and chamfered the edges

### Description

For this assignment I had to use drawings to create a swing arm

### Reflection

following the drawings to create the part was very difficult and Kaz helped alot. It was annoying how dimensions were on different drawings instead of being on a single drawing

## Multi-Part Design Studio

### Description

I had to follow drawings to build a cylinder thing in Onshape using a single part studio with multiple parts

### Evidence

### Reflection

following these drawings was easier than the swing arm and building it was pretty easy. Dimensions that are in parenthesese and grayed out our dimensions that are relative to other parts.
